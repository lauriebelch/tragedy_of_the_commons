# tragedy_of_the_commons

Code for analysis of the collective investment game for the manuscript

"Developmental constraints enforce altruism and avert the tragedy of the commons in a social microbe"

- **ESS_with_transdifferentiation.R** calculates the ESS when strains make adaptive responses to transdifferentiation
- **Error_investment_thresholds.R** calculates the thresholds of relatedness at which strains invest, for varying magnitude and frequency-dependancyness of error
- **Effects_of_transdifferentiation.R** calculates how transdifferentiation changes allocated investment into realised investment
- **ESS_wth_bethedging** calculates how the ESS changes when strains can use bet-hedging across different magnitudes of error in estimating relatedness
